# BASIC UNDERSTANDING
# software 
- more than just a program 
- program is an executable code, which serves some computational purpose
- collection of executable
- with specific req its software product

- Software engineering is an engineering branch associated with development of software product using well-defined 
scientific principles, methods and procedures


## Software type 
- System - OS
- application - adobephotoshop
- engineering - matlab
- Embeded - Rasspberry pi
- AI software - chatgpt

## Charachterstic of a good software
- Operational -talks about functionality
- Transitional - enviormentali like os,mac, linux
- Maintanable

# SDLC

- planning
- Defining
- Desgining
- Building
- Testing
- Deployment

## planning
- primitive stage
- Analysis and Requr. Gathering
- Subject mater expert 
- o/p study various technical approcaches with min risk
## Defining
-  Documnetation    
- talks about prodcut requirment
- approve it from customer or market analyst
- Done through SRS(Software req specifation)

## Desgining
- To create DDS(Design Document Specification)
- Product architecture is proposed & documneted


## Building
- Development starts here
- SRS+DDS= developers
## Testing
- Subset of all the stage 
- defextss are reported,tracked until it reaches product requirment

### 2types of testing
- manual and test automation
### 3 methods of testing 
- blackbox, whitebox & greybox
### 2 levels
#### functional
- unit testing, integration testing , UAT, regression, alpha and beta testing
#### non functional
- security , usabitlity, safety , load , stress and performance testing

## Deployment
- product is tested and ready to deploy 

# SDLC models
- Waterfall Model
- Iterative Model
- Spiral Model
- V-Model
- BigBang Model
- Agile Model


### Waterfall model
- Talks about Whole application at once, 
- No Changes are entertained
- Easy to manage
- Easy to arrange tracks


- High amaount of risk
- Not for complex model
- Poor for long period model


#### Process
- -> Requ specif.
- --> System Desgin
- ---> Desgin Implementation
- ----> Verification $ Testing
- -----> System Deployment
- ------> Software Maintaince

### Agile Methodologies
- Feedbackss, collaboration introduced here

- Comes with Agile Manifesto
- Individuals and Interactions over process & tools

- Working Software over comphrensive documentation
-  customer collaboration over contract negotiation (Feedbacks)
-  Changes were valued


### priciples
- customer satisfaction
- welcome changes
- collaboration
- motivations
- face2face converstaion

# Scrum 
- agile methodolgies
- Scrum is an agile project management framework that helps teams structure and manage their work through a set of values, principles, and practices
- Incremental builds deliver through sprint(time boxed event)


----------------------------------------------
                    SCRUM EVENTS
----------------------------------------------

- sprint planning event 
- sprint backlog
- Daily scrum
- Sprint review event
- sprint retrospective event

## Scrum Roles
#### Product Owner
- Understands the product very well
- Create and priotize backlogs

#### Scrum Master
- Helps team to undesrtand and apply scrum to achive common goal
- supports PO

#### Dev Team
-  Developer, tester, writer , UIUX

# Agile vs Traditional Methodologies

| **Agile Methodologies**                         | **Traditional Methodologies**                                             |
|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Incremental value and risk management            | Phased approach with an attempt to know everything at the start          |
| Embracing change                                 | Change prevention                                                         |
| Deliver early, fail early                        | Deliver at the end, fail at the end                                       |
| Transparency                                     | Detailed planning, stagnant control                                       |
| Inspect and adapt                                | Meta solutions, tightly controlled procedures and final answers           |
| Self managed                                     | Command and control                                                       |
| Continual learning                               | Learning is secondary to the pressure of delivery                         |
